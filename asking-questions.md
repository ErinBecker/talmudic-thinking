### Generate Questions

Read the Torah verse below. 

> And these words which I command you today . . .you shall discuss them . . . when you lie down and when you rise. (Deuteronomy 6:6-7)

This verse is generally understood to mean that a person is obligated to recite the words of the 
Shema at nighttime and in the morning. What questions are left unanswered? If you had no other information than that given here and believed there was a right and necessary way to do this, what questions would you need to ask? 

Do not try to answer your questions! As you come up with questions, it may be useful to consider "who?", "what?", "when?", 
"where?", "why?", and "how?"

### Some Possible Questions

Some possible questions learners may come up with include the following: 

- What exactly are these words that need to be recited? 
- Does "when you lie down" and "when you rise" refer literally to when an individual goes to bed and gets up? Or in general when people lie down or get up? 
- Do I have to say "these words" in the original language they were given (Hebrew) or can I say them in a language I understand? If I don't understand Hebrew, do I have to say them in a language I understand?
- What if I lie down and get up multiple times per day? 
- What if I work the night shift?
- Do I have to say "these words" out loud? If so, does it have to be audible to myself or to other people? 
- What if I get interupted in the middle of saying "these words"?
