The Mishnah's origin story (add stuff about opening chapter of Pirkei Avot) presents itself as having been transmitted orally in an unbroken chain from Moses to the "Men of the Great Assembly". However, even the Mishnah includes disagreements between sages in what was transmitted. In the Gemara, the Sages discuss some of these disagreements, introduce alternative sources (baraitot), and ask additional questions beyond those assumed by the Mishnah.
